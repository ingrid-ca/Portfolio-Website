        <h1>CityUnderground mobile travel app</h1>

        <p>When traveling to a new city, it can sometimes be difficult to find the best places to go or the best events to attend. A lot of times we can be unaware of what's happening in a big city when we're visiting, as visitors tend to get bombarded with touristy information that isn't always relevant to every individual's personal tastes and desires. CityUnderground is a travel app that helps you find niche places and events so you can live more like the locals and/or more according to your specific and personal interests when you're visiting a new city.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this, I conducted interviews to determine the need for an app like this, analyzed competitors, synthesized my data, and developed an interactive prototype.</p>

    <section class="research" id="research">
        <h2>-research-</h2>
        <p>First, I conducted one-on-one interviews with five well-traveled friends of mine to determine what they look for in a travel experience and how they use apps to assist them when they travel. With this information, I organized my notes into an affinity diagram and an empathy map. I also performed a competitor analysis on four potential travel app competitors to see where CityUnderground could do things differently.</p>

    <section class="synthesis" id="synthesis">
        <h2>-synthesis-</h2>
        <p>I synthesized my findings into an "I like, I wish, what if" chart and a feature prioritization matrix. I then filled out a value proposition canvas and created a value proposition statement which said, "I am developing a travel app to help people visiting urban centers around the globe find places and events that are specific to their unique interests, goals, tastes, and personalities, to solve the online problems of time-consuming searching and irrelevent recommendations.</p>

    <section class="ideation" id="ideation">
        <h2>-ideation-</h2>
        <p>For ideation, I started by constructing a user flow with three possible user paths for a first-time user of the app:</p>

    <section class="wireframing" id="wireframing">
        <h2>-wireframing-</h2>
        <p>I chose the user path of "create an account" for my wireframe sketches. I created four screens for the onboarding process:</p>

    <section class="prototyping" id="prototyping">
        <h2>-prototyping-</h2>
        <p>With Figma, I then created prototypes of my screens:</p>

    </section>
    <section class="-testing-" id="testing">
        <h2>-testing-</h2>
        <p>Next, I conducted two tests to see how people felt about the process of creating an account on this app and to see what their reactions were to each of the different screens.</p>

    <section class="iterations" id="iterations">
        <h2>-iterations-</h2>
        <p>The general conclusion was that though the onboarding process seemed to be easy and simple, it was suggested that I get rid of the page asking about notifications - or else put it on the page where you input your email and all other information. I made this iteration and also added some more color and style to my prototype:</p>

    <section class="conclusions" id="conclusions">
        <h2>-conclusions-</h2>
        <p>I really enjoyed coming up with the idea for this app and I wish I'd had more time to work on the UI. Perhaps someday in future I'll return to this project because I do believe it has potential and now only just feels like a very rough draft of something that could actually be quite good.</p>
